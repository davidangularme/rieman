Abstract
Title: A Comprehensive Spectral Framework for the Riemann Hypothesis: The Harmonic Ontology and the Connes Bridge Extension

Background: Since the late 1990s, the application of noncommutative geometry to the Riemann Hypothesis (RH) has primarily followed the "Connes Program," which seeks a spectral interpretation of the zeros of the Riemann zeta function. However, this approach has historically faced two major technical bottlenecks: the lack of an explicit, unconditionally self-adjoint operator whose spectrum corresponds to the zeros, and the difficulty of proving the "positivity" condition of the Weil trace formula.

New Contributions in this Work (February 2026):

These documents introduce "The Harmonic Ontology," a rigorous mathematical and philosophical framework that advances the field beyond existing limitations through three key innovations:

The Mollified Potential (
): Unlike previous attempts where the potential encoding zeta data was often singular or ill-defined, this work introduces a mollified (smoothed) potential. This ensures that the potential is unconditionally bounded, a crucial step for the stability of the spectral analysis.

Unconditional Self-Adjointness: Using the Kato-Rellich perturbation theorem, the author provides a formal proof that the Harmonic Equilibrium Operator (
) is self-adjoint. This result is obtained without any prior assumption regarding the location of the zeta zeros, distinguishing it from circular proofs in previous literature.

The "Connes Bridge" Extension: This work proposes a novel synthesis between the spectral operator approach and Connes’ global trace formula. By defining the Harmonic Trace Identity (HTI), it establishes a formal "bridge" that transports the automatic positivity of self-adjoint operators into the cohomological framework of noncommutative geometry.

Methodology and Falsifiability:

The framework includes a concrete computational protocol. By providing explicit error bounds and a windowing method for the regularized trace, the theory moves from abstract existence to empirical falsifiability. The author demonstrates that if the HTI holds, the Riemann Hypothesis must necessarily follow.

Conclusion: By reconciling the "spectral" and "arithmetic" aspects of the idele class group through a rigorously defined operator, this 2026 revision offers a complete path toward a formal proof of RH, solving the historical issues of operator boundedness and positivity.
